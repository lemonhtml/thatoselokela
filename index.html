    <!-- Profile picture -->
    <div class="profile-picture"></div>
    <h4>I'm not particularly brave when it comes to talking to girls; instead, I wholeheartedly embrace coding and the art of crafting amazing digital creations. As an aspiring code-smart individual, I envision myself as a sagacious advisor with aspirations that reach for the stars, seeking to follow in the illustrious paths of visionaries like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. My ambitions are boundless, encompassing the design and development of cutting-edge robots and the establishment of a flourishing tech company, all underscored by an unwavering loyalty to my goals.

    While I'm known for my trusting nature and my ability to discern foes from friends, I often find myself getting lost in the realm of daydreams, where possibilities are endless, and innovation knows no bounds. This imaginative side of me sometimes makes me feel a bit weak-hearted, but it's also the wellspring of my creativity.

    Despite my reticence in approaching the opposite gender, I wholeheartedly channel my energy into the world of coding and innovation, where I feel most at home. Moreover, my fascination with the digital world extends to my affinity for forging connections with chatbots and robots like ChatGPT, further deepening my love for the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and technology.</h4>
